# Emotion and Response Prediction from Scenarios  

## Overview  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that analyzes scenarios and predicts:  
1. **How a person might feel (emotion)** based on the given situation.  
2. **An appropriate response** tailored to the context of the scenario.  

The ultimate goal is to create an intelligent system capable of understanding human emotions and generating empathetic, context-aware responses. This repository serves as a collaborative platform for developers and researchers to refine, enhance, and extend the project's capabilities.  


## Current Status  
The current implementation includes:  
- A basic machine learning pipeline that **classifies scenarios into predefined emotion labels** using a Naive Bayes classifier.  
- Text preprocessing, including stopword removal, punctuation handling, and vectorization with TF-IDF.  
- Evaluation of the classification model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

However, the current dataset only contains scenarios and their corresponding labels. Expanding the dataset to include emotional causes and responses is essential for achieving the project's goals.  


## Goals  
1. Expand the dataset to include the following columns:  
   - **Scenario**: Description of the situation or event.  
   - **Emotion**: The emotional reaction to the scenario (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.).  
   - **Response**: An appropriate response or action based on the scenario.  
2. Modify the model to handle **multi-output predictions**, allowing it to predict both emotion and response.  
3. Explore advanced NLP models (e.g., transformers like BERT or GPT) for improved performance.  


## Dataset Requirements  
For the project to progress, the dataset should include the following fields:  

| **Scenario**                  | **Emotion**       | **Response**                                  |  
|-------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| "I lost my job today."        | Sad               | "Offer comfort and explore new opportunities."|  
| "I aced my exam!"             | Happy             | "Celebrate the success and reward yourself."  |  
| "I argued with a close friend."| Angry/Frustrated | "Calm down and consider apologizing later."   |  

If you want to contribute a dataset, ensure it follows this format and contains diverse, realistic scenarios.
